Dear Motasem,

You have 3 days to complete the following full-stack assignment. Treat this as a production-quality endeavor, building clean, maintainable, and well-structured code using TypeScript throughout both the front-end and back-end.

Requirements

User Onboarding: Implement secure registration and login flows. Ensure proper session handling and user authentication.
Product Listing: Create a fully functional product listing page. Implement back-end endpoints to persist and retrieve product data from a suitable data store (e.g., a database), and display the results on the front-end with sorting or filtering as needed.
Stack & Practices

Front-End:
Use React with TypeScript. Organize your components, ensure logical state management, and handle data fetching with clarity and consistency.
Back-End:
Use Node.js or Nest.js with TypeScript. Implement a structured API with clear endpoints for authentication and product operations. Utilize a database or another persistence layer to store user and product data—no mocks needed.
Code Quality:
Write production-level code with strong error handling, modular architecture, and a unified coding style.
Additional Instructions

Include a brief documentation of your system’s architecture and data flow.
Once complete, publish your code to a public GitHub repository and share the link.
We look forward to reviewing your work. Good luck!

Best regards,
Emad
